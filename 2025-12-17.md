### Andy Pavlo

- Congratulations to the #1 ranked @db.cs.cmu.edu PhD student Wan Shen Lim (@wslim.bsky.social) for successfully passing his doctoral defense. Wan has been working on hard AF database research with me for the last *nine* years at CMU (undergrad+grad). He also hates chickens.

### Armin Ronacher

- I don't use Claude's plan mode. I made some potentially uninformed statements today about plan mode, so I learned what it does by looking at the code. This might or might not be useful to you. <https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/12/17/what-is-plan-mode/> [Link](https://bsky.app/profile/mitsuhiko.at/post/3ma7jqsvvu22d)

### Andy Grove

- There is a new Comet issue to discuss the future of Iceberg support and whether we should focus on using the iceberg-rust or Java implementation of Iceberg. Please add your thoughts if this is something that you care about! <https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/issues/2921> [Link](https://bsky.app/profile/andygrove.io/post/3ma73klnu722s)

## GitHub Releases

- llvm/llvm-project: LLVM 21.1.8 — LLVM 21.1.8 Release Linux x86_64 ( signature ) Linux Arm64 ( signature ) macOS Apple Silicon (ARM64) ( signature ) Windows x64 (64-bit): installer ( signature ), archive ( signature ) Windows x86 (32-bit): installer ( signature ) For any other variants of platform and architecture, check the full list of release packages at the bottom of this release page. If you do not find a release package for your platform, you may be able to find a community built package on the LLVM Discourse forum thread for this release. Remember that these are built by volunteers and may not always be available. If you rely on a platform or configuration that is not one of the defaults, we suggest you use the binaries that your platform provides, or build your own release packages. Package Types Each platform has one binary release package. The file name starts with either LLVM- or clang+llvm- and ends with the platform's name. For example, LLVM-21.1.8-Linux-ARM64.tar.xz contains LLVM binaries for Arm64 Linux. Except for Windows. Where LLVM-*.exe is an installer intended for using LLVM as a toolchain and the archive clang+llvm- contains the contents of the installer, plus libraries and tools not normally used in a toolchain. You most likely want the LLVM- installer, unless you are developing software which itself uses LLVM, in which case choose clang+llvm- . In addition, source archives are available: -21.1.8.src.tar.xz are archives of the sources of specific sub-projects of llvm-project (except for test-suite which is an archive of the LLVM Test Suite ). To get all the llvm-project source code for this release, choose llvm-project-21.1.8.src.tar.xz . Verifying Packages All packages come with a matching .sig or .jsonl file. You should use these to verify the integrity of the packages. If it has a .sig file, it should have been signed by the release managers using GPG. Download the keys from the LLVM website , import them into your keyring and use them to verify the file: .sig "> $ gpg --import release-keys.asc $ gpg --verify .sig If it has a .jsonl file, use gh to verify the package: (if you are able to connect to GitHub) $ gh attestation verify --repo llvm/llvm-project --bundle .jsonl (using attestation file on disk)"> $ gh attestation verify --repo llvm/llvm-project (if you are able to connect to GitHub) $ gh attestation verify --repo llvm/llvm-project --bundle .jsonl (using attestation file on disk) [Link](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-21.1.8)
