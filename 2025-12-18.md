### Phil Eaton

- Tonight is the last night of NYC Systems talks of 2025! With Larry Diehl of Colimit and Jeff Swenson of Cockroach Labs it should be fun! If you didn't get an invite and still want to come we've got a spot or two. DM [Post](https://bsky.app/profile/eatonphil.bsky.social/post/3mabwddrwpk2r)
- Frederick Allen's Secret Formula history of Coke was a 5/5 for me. Lots of good lessons on competition (with Pepsi and Keurig Dr Pepper) and product evolution (New Coke, Diet Coke). [Post](https://bsky.app/profile/eatonphil.bsky.social/post/3mabmmk6fzk2d)

### Sylvain Wallez

- La dérive des enquêtes de satisfaction : une note sur 10, mais si c'est pas 9 ou 10, alors il y a un problème. Du coup on affiche par tiers, avec 1 à 6 tassés dans le premier. Et si on mettait juste "pas content, neutre, content" ? Ou même, soyons fous, et si on arrêtait de nous emmerder avec ça ? [Post](https://bsky.app/profile/swallez.com/post/3mabpkbg5ns2j)
- My former team at Elastic is hiring a .Net developer to work on client libraries and integrations with the .Net ecosystem. Great job, full remote, all in the open! [contains quote post or other embedded content] [Post](https://bsky.app/profile/swallez.com/post/3maanizubuc2q)

### Simon Willison

- I see a lot of complaints about untested AI slop in pull requests. Submitting those is a dereliction of duty as a software engineer: Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work <https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/> [Post](https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3mabgqn5o3k2g)
